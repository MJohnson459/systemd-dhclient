# Description: DHCLIENT 'enter' Script for shorewall firewall 
#              Gets executed when DHCLIENT receives an assigned IP address
#
# Security: until dhclient does process-capability-drop of Linux 
# capabilities 
# (Ubuntu patched in 2005, not upstreamed yet)
# (Ubuntu patched in 2018, 
#    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isc-dhcp/+bug/1759032 )
# File permission should be 0640
# File ownership should be root:root
# Scope of reading environment file is at systetmd's assigned
#     environment and Linux capabilities.
#
# Tips:
# * Be careful about changing the environment since this is sourced
# * This script fragment uses bash features
# * As of isc-dhcp-client 4.2 the "reason" (for running this script) can 
#       be one of the following (from dhclient-script(8) man page):
#    MEDIUM(0) 
#    PREINIT(0)  
#    BOUND(M)  
#    RENEW(M)  
#    REBIND(M)  
#    REBOOT(M)         
#    EXPIRE(D)  
#    FAIL(D) 
#    RELEASE(D)  
#    STOP(D) 
#    NBI(-) 
#    TIMEOUT(M)
# Below are also used in dhclient master script (default: /sbin/dhclient-script)
#    ARPCHECK(0)
#    ARPSEND(0)
#    PREINIT6(0) 
#    BOUND6(M)
#    RENEW6(M)
#    REBIND6(M)
#    DEPREF6(0)
#    EXPIRE6(D)
#    RELEASE6(D)
#    STOP6(D)
# Legend:
#   (0) = master script does not run make_resolv_conf
#   (M) = master script runs make_resolv_conf
#   (D) = master script downs interface
#   (-) = master script does nothing with this
#
